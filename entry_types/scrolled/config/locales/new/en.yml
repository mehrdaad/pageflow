          inline_help: >
            This setting allows you to control the position of the element in relation to
            surrounding text blocks: the element can prominently stand alone ("Full Width"), it can
            be anchored within the text ("Inline") or it can be positioned adjacent to the text
            ("Sticky"). Sticky elements remain static in the middle of the viewport alongside the
            text until either the section is scrolled out of the viewport or until they get pushed
            upwards by the next sticky element of the section. On mobile devices sticky elements
            automatically get positioned inline. Sticky elements work particularly well on desktop
            devices in combination with long texts.
          values:

              This setting controls how the scrolling foreground should get dimmed to
              increase contrast from the background. The option "Cards" adds a box with rounded
              corners to the foreground, with "Shadow" you can add a light or dark shadow to
              increase readability and "Block" adds an opaque area.

              The section background can either display an image, a color or a video loop.
              In case of background images you can specify the main image motif area. This area will
              then initially be left uncovered by foreground content on mobile as well as desktop

              Deactivate this option to create a short section which height is determined by its
              foreground content. This option needs to be activated for two adjacent sections

              This setting defines the transition when scrolling from the previous
              section to the current. The different settings have specific effects concerning the
              behaviors of background and foreground. The effects "Cross-Fade All" and
